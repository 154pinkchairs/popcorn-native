# popcorn-native
Native implementation of the Popcorn Time torrent streaming app, written in Rust

This project is, as one can see, not under too much of active development. But that doesn't mean that it won't be developed in the future. I'd rather keep it public to gauge the interest in it and get back to it when I got more time.

# Release schedule

**Oct-Nov 2023**: backend MVP

**Nov-Jan 2023/24:** usable GUI

Later stages? Time will show...
